# How to create a Virtual Machine for esp8266

Perhaps you’ve heard of the ESP8266 but don’t know what it is.
Perhaps you’ve read some articles about the ESP8266 and want to get your hands on one.
Or perhaps you’re a hardcore hacker and just like building virtual machines. 

Whatever your reasons are, this post will tell you everything you need to know to build a custom virtual machine with all the necessary tools to develop projects using an ESP8266.

In this blog post we are going to build a custom virtual machine that can run code compiled for the ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller. 
We will be using QEMU, an open source virtual machine monitor, and Arduino IDE, which requires no introduction if you are into IoT development.

If this feels too much like reading (and not enough like breaking things), then go out there and build something cool!
